*************************** READ ME ************************************

1. Uploading
Links to all images, javaScript, and CSS stylesheets reference the folders
they are stored in. To ensure that the style remains consistent, images
are found, and javaScript is used, please do not move files from their
folders.

2. CSS
Please, do NOT change the file "boostrap.css" in any way.
All adjustments to style can be done in the CSS stylesheet "custom.css"
Each area of the stylesheet is labeled, and it's purpose explained. Change
all you'd like.

3. JavaScript
The javaScript files "js-min" and "carousel" must not be deleted or changed.
Custom javaScript can be added to the end of each file, between two "<script></script>"
tags, or in another javaScript file. This is optional, if you'd like to add more.

4. Links
For the ticket purchase and donation, no links are currently in place. In the HTML
document, these areas are clearly marked as "Buttons".
The lines which need a link added to them are indicated with additional comments as well.
The "buttons" area is found near the bottom of each of the HTML pages.

5. Issues with links (?)
The links found in the navigation bar should work as is. It will take the root name of
wherever you load them to, and then append the page onto it (Example: safg.org would be the
root, and "main.html" would append, creating a link to "safg.org/main.html" even though the
link section only says "main.html").
If  this does not work because of an issue with how or where the files are loaded, I have
clearly marked where you can upload the links in the navagion section. This is OPTIONAL, and
is simply there just in case =)
